    "## CNN Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Object recognition and categorization using TensorFlow required a basic understanding of convolutions (for CNNs), common layers (non-linearity, pooling, fc), image loading, image manipulation and colorspaces. With these areas covered, it's possible to build a CNN model for image recognition and classification using TensorFlow. In this case, the model is a dataset provided by Stanford which includes pictures of dogs and their corresponding breed. The network needs to train on these pictures then be judged on how well it can guess a dog's breed based on a picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "The network architecture follows a simplified version of [Alex Krizhevsky's AlexNet](https://code.google.com/p/cuda-convnet/) without all of AlexNet's layers. This architecture was described earlier in the chapter as the network which won ILSVRC'12 top challenge. The network uses layers and techniques familiar to this chapter which are similar to the [TensorFlow provided](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.8/tutorials/deep_cnn/index.html) tutorial on CNNs.\n",

    "### Stanford Dogs Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used for training this model can be found on Stanford's computer vision site [http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/). Training the model requires downloading relevant data. After downloading the Zip archive of all the images, extract the archive into a new directory called `imagenet-dogs` in the same directory as the code building the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Zip archive provided by Stanford includes pictures of dogs organized into 120 different breeds. The goal of this model is to train on 80% of the dog breed images and then test using the remaining 20%. If this were a production model, part of the raw data would be reserved for cross-validation of the results. Cross-validation is a useful step to validate the accuracy of a model but this model is designed to illustrate the process and not for competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The organization of the archive follows ImageNet's practices. Each dog breed is a directory name similar to `n02085620-Chihuahua` where the second half of the directory name is the dog's breed in English (`Chihuahua`). Within each directory there is a variable amount of images related to that breed. Each image is in JPEG format (RGB) and of varying sizes. The different sized images is a challenge because TensorFlow is expecting tensors of the same dimensionality."

Converting the images into TFRecord files in advance of training will help keep training fast and simplify matching the label of the image. Another benefit is that the training and testing related images can be separated in advance. Separated training and testing datasets allows continual testing of a model while training is occurring using checkpoint files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Converting the images will require changing their colorspace into grayscale, resizing the images to be of uniform size and attaching the label to each image. This conversion should only happen once before training commences and likely will take a long time."

The logic isn't different from earlier examples except that the operation `tf.image.resize_images` is used. The resizing operation will scale every image to be the same size even if it distorts the image. For example, if an image in portrait orientation and an image in landscape orientation were both resized with this code then the output of the landscape image would become distorted. These distortions are caused because `tf.image.resize_images` doesn't take into account aspect ratio (the ratio of height to width) of an image.

Instead of using `tf.nn.softmax` on this string, the label needs to be converted to be a unique number for each label. Converting these labels into an integer representation should be done in preprocessing.\n",

    "CNNs have multiple moving parts which can cause issues during training resulting in poor accuracy. Debugging problems in a CNN often start with investigating how the filters (kernels) are changing every iteration. Each weight used in a filter is constantly changing as the network attempts to learn the most accurate set of weights to use based on the train method.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a well designed CNN, when the first convolution layer is started, the initialized input weights are set to be random (in this case using `weight_init=tf.random_normal`). These weights activate over an image and the output of the activation (feature map) is random as well. Visualizing the feature map as if it were an image, the output looks like the original image with static applied. The static is caused by all the weights activating at random. Over many iterations, each filter becomes more uniform as the weights are adjusted to fit the training feedback. As the network converges, the filters resemble distinct small patterns which can be found in the image.\n",

Adding an image summary output to a graph gives a good overview of the filters being used and the feature map generated by applying them to the input images.\n",
