This will be the first tensor being convolved and the second tensor will be `kernel`. *Kernel* is an important term that is interchangeable with *weights*, *filter*, *convolution matrix* or *mask*. Since this task is computer vision related, it's useful to use the term kernel because it is being treated as an [image kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing). There is no practical difference in the term when used to describe this functionality in TensorFlow. The parameter in TensorFlow is named `filter` and it expects a set of weights which will be learned from training. The amount of different weights included in the kernel (`filter` parameter) will configure the amount of kernels which will be learned.\n",

Channel is a term from computer vision which describes the output vector, for example an RGB image has three channels represented as a rank 1 tensor `[red, green, blue]`.

TensorFlow will pad the image with zeros or raise an error when the sizes don't allow a kernel to stride over an image without going past its bounds. The amount of zeros or the error state of `tf.nn.conv2d` is controlled by the parameter `padding` which has two possible values ('VALID', 'SAME').\n",

    "The values in the kernel were adjusted with the center of the kernel increased in intensity and the areas around the kernel reduced in intensity. The change, matches patterns with intense pixels and increases their intensity outputting an image which is visually sharpened. Note that the corners of the kernel are all `0` and don't affect the output which operates in a plus shaped pattern.\n",

    "These kernels match patterns in images at a rudimentary level. A convolutional neural network matches edges and more by using a complex kernel it learned during training. The starting values for the kernel are usually random and over time they're trained by the CNN's learning layer. When a CNN is complete, it starts running and each image sent in is convolved with a kernel which is then changed based on if the predicted value matches the labeled value of the image. For example, if a Sheepdog picture is considered a Pit Bull by the CNN being trained it will then change the filters a small amount to try and match Sheepdog pictures better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning complex patterns with a CNN involves more than a single layer of convolution. Even the example code included a `tf.nn.relu` layer used to prepare the output for visualization. Convolution layers may occur more than once in a CNN but they'll likely include other layer types as well. These layers combined form the support network required for a successful CNN architecture."
