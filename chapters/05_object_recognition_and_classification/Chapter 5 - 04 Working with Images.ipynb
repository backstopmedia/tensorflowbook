TensorFlow makes it easier to work with images but it's still a challenge. The largest challenge working with images are the size of the tensor which is eventually loaded. Every image requires a tensor the same size as the image's <span class=\"math-tex\" data-type=\"tex\">\\\\(height \\* width \\* channels\\\\)</span>.
