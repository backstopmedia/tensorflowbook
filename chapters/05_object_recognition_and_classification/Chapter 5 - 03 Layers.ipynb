    "\n",
    "These functions are used in combination with the output of other layers to generate a feature map. They're used to smooth (or differentiate) the results of certain operations. The goal is to introduce non-linearity into the neural network. Non-linearity means that the input is a curve instead of a straight line. Curves are capable of representing more complex changes in input. For example, non-linear input is capable of describing input which stays small for the majority of the time but periodically has a single point at an extreme. Introduction of non-linearity in a neural network allows it to train on the complex patterns found in data.\n",

    "TensorFlow has [multiple activation functions](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.8/api_docs/python/nn.html#activation-functions) available. With CNNs, `tf.nn.relu` is primarily used because of its performance although it sacrifices information. When starting out, using `tf.nn.relu` is recommended but advanced users may create their own. When considering if an activation function is useful there are a few primary considerations.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The function is [**monotonic**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotonic_function), so its output should always be increasing or decreasing along with the input. This allows gradient descent optimization to search for local minima.\n",
    "2. The function is [**differentiable**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_function), so there must be a derivative at any point in the function's domain. This allows gradient descent optimization to properly work using the output from this style of activation function.\n",

For object recognition and classification, the input layer is a `tf.nn.conv2d` layer which accepts images. The next step is to use real images in training instead of example input in the form of `tf.constant` or `tf.range` variables."
