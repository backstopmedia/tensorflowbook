TensorFlow makes it easier to work with images but it's still a challenge. The largest challenge working with images are the size of the tensor which is eventually loaded. Every image requires a tensor the same size as the image's <span class=\"math-tex\" data-type=\"tex\">\\\\(height \\* width \\* channels\\\\)</span>.

    "In these examples, `tf.to_float` is often used in order to illustrate changing an image's type to another format. For examples, this works OK but TensorFlow has a built in function to properly scale values as they change types. `tf.image.convert_image_dtype(image, dtype, saturate=False)` is a useful shortcut to change the type of an image from `tf.uint8` to `tf.float`."
