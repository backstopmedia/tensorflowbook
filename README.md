# _TensorFlow for Machine Intelligence_

![TensorFlow for Machine Intelligence book cover](img/book_cover.jpg)

Welcome to the official book repository for [_TensorFlow for Machine Intelligence_](https://bleedingedgepress.com/tensor-flow-for-machine-intelligence/)! Here, you'll find code from the book for easy testing on your own machine, as well as errata, and any additional content we can squeeze in down the line.

* **Code:** You'll find code for each chapter inside of the [chapters directory](https://github.com/backstopmedia/tensorflowbook/tree/master/chapters)
* **Errata:** Errata will be added to the [errata](https://github.com/backstopmedia/tensorflowbook/tree/master/errata) directory as they are discovered. Send in a pull request if you have errata to report!
